/*
Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below:

    1)Accepts the following arguments: the first argument is a 
    full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, 
    referred to below as writefile; the second argument is a text 
    string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr

    2)Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified

    3)Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, 
    overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesnâ€™t exist. 
    Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
